# CRM-System-with-Spring-Framework
This project is basically a Spring framework skeleton of buiding any project from scratch with support of Dependency injection, 
Transaction Management(transaction propagation and rollbacks), DAO support with JdbcTemplate including connection pools from 
Apache DBCP and Spring AOP to get the running time of every service class method. For wiring, legacy XML style is used. 
However the project would also have a version using Hibernate &amp; JPA and as configuration style Annotation would be used.
